# Guess the button(n buttons)

This project is similar to the "Guess the button" project, only that this one allows the user to choose from how many buttons he has to guess the correct one.

When the page is loaded, it is presenting to the user a text field where he has to introduce a number. That number 'n' will be used to generate 'n' buttons on the screen and one of the 'n' buttons will be chosen randomly to be the correct button. Just like the original "Guess the button" project, if the correct button is pressed, then the message "You win!" will be shown and it will tell you to reload the page if you want to restart the game; if not, then the message "Wrong button. Try again!" will be shown.

This project was made by using JavaScript.
